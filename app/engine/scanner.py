"""Scan service: drives the engine over candles not yet scanned and writes zones, events,
plans and rejections to the database. One instrument and one timeframe at a time.

Built to be cheap when nothing changed and to never hold up the web pages:
- a timeframe with no new candle since its last scan is skipped without loading anything;
- zones found during a scan live in memory and are written in one go at the end;
- on a long catch-up (the first scan of a stock) zones that were used up long ago are not stored at all;
- scan_key() opens its own database session, so it can run in a worker thread."""
